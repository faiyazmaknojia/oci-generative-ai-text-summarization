# Enterprise Text Summarization using OCI Generative AI Concepts

## Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-based text summarization workflow inspired by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI services. The goal is to showcase how enterprise documents can be summarized efficiently using AI-driven approaches aligned with Oracle’s AI ecosystem.

## Oracle Technologies Referenced
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
- OCI Generative AI
- Oracle LiveLabs (AI-focused workshops)

## Project Objective
To build a simple and clear text summarization example that reflects how Oracle Generative AI services can be used in enterprise environments for knowledge extraction and document analysis.

## How the Project Works
1. A sample enterprise text document is provided as input.
2. The Python script processes the input and generates a concise summary.
3. The logic represents a simplified version of an AI summarization workflow for learning purposes.

## What I Learned
- Core concepts behind OCI Generative AI services
- How enterprise text summarization workflows are designed
- Prompt-based AI summarization principles
- Oracle’s approach to integrating AI into enterprise solutions

## Product Usage Evidence
Oracle LiveLabs were completed to gain hands-on exposure to OCI Generative AI and Oracle AI services. Screenshots included in the repository demonstrate participation in AI-focused labs, understanding of service workflows, and enterprise AI use cases.

## Use Cases
- Policy and compliance document summarization
- Technical documentation review
- Enterprise knowledge management
- AI-assisted decision support
